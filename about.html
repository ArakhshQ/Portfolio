 <p class="about">I'm a high school graduate from Afghanistan. My journey with programming began in 2023. I started with a small idea in mind. Since then, I've found a deep interest in web development and exploring programming languages. Besides coding, I spend my time in reading books, preping for college and playing games. I also have a huge interest in poetry and philosophy.
 I can speak 5 languages: Persian, Pashto, English, Turkish, Urdu. I also know a little German.</p>
