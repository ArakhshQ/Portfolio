<div class="about">
<p>I’m a high school graduate from Afghanistan with a passion for programming. I began my programming journey in 2023 by creating a website for my school, which sparked my interest in coding. Since then, I have developed a strong passion for web development and exploring new programming languages. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, preparing for college, playing games, and exploring poetry and philosophy. I speak five languages — Persian, Pashto, English, Turkish, and Urdu — and have basic knowledge of German.</p>
